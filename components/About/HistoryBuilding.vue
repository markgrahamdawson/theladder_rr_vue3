      <div>
        Cornish philanthropist John Passmore Edwards founded th Rdruth Library,
        now The Ladder, as part of a building programme initiated to deal with
        unemployment in 1895 after the copper mining industry rapidly declined
        in Redruth. He bequeathed £2,000 for the construction of the library to
        match Octavius Allen Ferris of Truro's sum for the provision of free
        libraries. "There was no reason why libraries", he said, "should not be
        universal - in every town, many, and in every village, one." The
        building was designed by Redruth architect James Hicks, more than 7,000
        people gathered witness Passmore Edwards lay the foundation stone, a
        day's holiday was declared, and the towns people celebrated with
        carnival and fireworks. The Passmore Edwards Free Library is a symbol of
        education, hope, nurture, and opportunities. All twenty of the Passmore
        Edwards buildings in cornwall have survived.
