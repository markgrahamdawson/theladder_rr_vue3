        Redruth Former Library
      </p>
      <p class="m-2">
        At the beginning of the pandemic Redruth Library, an imposing granite building in the centre of the town, closed its doors for the last time. Hoardings went up. Kids threw stones at where they were once read bedtime stories. The roof caved into the space where Cornwall’s historic archives were stored, plaster and mould splattered over a bust of Cornwall’s most famous philanthropist Passmore Edwards. 
      </p>
      <p class="m-2">
        In 1894 Passmore Edwards built the building for the people of Redruth. In '22 Rift theatre company took on that legacy (as the Redruth Former Library Community Interest Company) to build an arts and culture hub.

      <p class="m-2">
        Redruth Former Library CIC is committed to preserving the former Library, cherished by the people of Redruth, for community use.
      </p>
      <p class="m-2">
        The CIC have been awarded UK Shared Prosperity funding for restoration of the building. They are a group of Cornish creative charities continuing the legacy of the library, in the words of Passmore Edwards, 'to advocate great principles, advance useful institutions and elevate man.
      </p>
      <p class="m-2">
        With the support of Redruth High Street Heritage Action Zone, the CIC plans to turn the vacant library building into thriving rehearsal and creative workspace, training, education, residency, project and co-working space, including a community cafe, outdoor courtyard, community allotment, kitchen and events space. The building will also host a biennial international theatre and performing arts festival.
